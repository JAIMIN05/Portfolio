// About me data

  title: 'MERN Stack Developer',
  bio: `Hello! üëã I'm Jaimin Kaneriya, a third-year student at CHARUSAT University with a burning passion for technology and a love for problem-solving. üíª

In my journey, I've delved deep into the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, honing my skills in both frontend and backend development. Proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJs, and Bootstrap for crafting beautiful and responsive user interfaces, while Node.js and Express.js empower me to build robust backend systems. MongoDB serves as my preferred database solution, enabling efficient data management for dynamic applications. üåê

Additionally, my fascination with algorithms and data structures led me to excel in DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms), particularly in Java. I'm proud to have achieved an NPTEL certificate in DSA using Java and have solved over 200+ LeetCode problems, continuously sharpening my problem-solving skills. üí°

I'm currently seeking opportunities to leverage my skills in a professional setting and contribute to meaningful projects that make a difference.`,
